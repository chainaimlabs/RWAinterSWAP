As More Reel world Tokenization , efforts move in to blockchain, it is increasingly evident that the SmartContract orchestrations needed for enterprise usecases are across multiple chains. Also, we have seen many instituions increasingly adopting public blockchians mainly the ethereum Ecosystem, 

the smart contract capabilities need co-ordination between multiple Ehereum based L2s. 
Also, they need a combination of on-chain and market intelligence that puts on-chain activity in context to market-risk triggers, which the institutional asset managers are accustomed to and measured on. This is critical for wider adoption and prolonged success for institutional defi and RWA tokenization. 

RWAinterswap integrates a hook with a riskengine used by cenral banks ( stating in a TEE environment ) for systemic risk and brings the same amount of risk intelligence to smart contract executions. These capabiltiies are particularly useful in the DEX / Perps enhancements to handle instituional  Commodities Futures contraccts, Forex Etc.., that actually might have to be set up for delivery versus promise accross multiple chains. 

To set dynamc fees based on for specific RWA asset pairs 
To syncrhronize between L2s thru oprimism superchain.
